# Smart Irrigation System
Our intelligent system is designed to effortlessly monitor and regulate soil moisture levels for your plants. It automatically waters them when necessary, ensuring they receive the perfect amount of hydration. Additionally, it keeps track of the water levels in the tank, notifying you when a refill is needed.

## How did we make it?
- Arduino Uno, which is the main hub that controls all our sensors and devices.
- Soil Moisture Sensor, used to monitor the moisture in the soil. (if the value goes below 450, meaning there isn't enough moisture for the plants)
- Water Sensor, which is used in the tank to monitor whether or not there is enough water in the tank to water the plants.
- Water Pump, which is used to dispense the water directly from the tank to the plants.
- Relay Switch, which is used to turn the pump on and off.
- Buzzer to alert the user that the tank is empty or has less water.
- LEDs, which indicate the moisture and water levels.
- LCD Screen that displays appopriate messages depending on the situation.
